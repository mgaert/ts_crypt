 A TypeScript implementation of the Unix crypt(3) call.
 
 This is a rewrite of the JavaScript port of the Java port of the original C source. It provides a crypt() function which will return a hash based on the input parameters.

   TypeScript The TypeScript Port by Michael GÃ¤rtner (mgaert@gmx.de)
   
   The port for TypeScript simplifies the callable interface, and cleans up the code.
   There is now a 'crypt' function that looks like and behaves the same as the C function of the same name.
   All of the other code and variables needed for the implementation are now in the 'Crypt3' name space.
   No class instance is required any more.
