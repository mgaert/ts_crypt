# TSCrypt
## A TypeScript implementation of the Unix crypt(3) call.

This is a rewrite of the JavaScript port of the Java port of the original C source. It provides a crypt() function which will return a hash based on the input parameters.

### The Java Port

   The port to Java is known as jcrypt.java and can be found at:

### The JavaScript Port
   
   The original JavaScript port can be found here:

### The TypeScript Port by Michael GÃ¤rtner (mgaert@gmx.de)

   The port for TypeScript simplifies the callable interface, and cleans up the code.
   There is now a static 'crypt' member that looks like and behaves the same as the C function of the same name.
