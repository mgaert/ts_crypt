A TypeScript implementation of the Unix crypt(3) call.

The TypeScript Port by Michael GÃ¤rtner (mgaert@gmx.de)
   
The port for TypeScript simplifies the callable interface, and cleans up the code.
There is now a static 'crypt' member that looks like and behaves the same as the C function of the same name.
